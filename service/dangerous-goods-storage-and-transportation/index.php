        <p class="what-we-do">WHAT WE DO</p>
        <pre>Dangerous cargo consists of substances that can pose risks to health, property, safety or to the environment. This classification is on account of the poisonous, flammable or corrosive nature of the cargo. Therefore, efficient storage and transportation solutions for dangerous goods are a mandate when it comes to handling cargo of such nature.

<a href="/">PLM Solutions</a> offers state-of-the-art storage and handling services for dangerous goods. All nine classes of dangerous goods are handled with the support of our global network through all means of transport, i.e. air, sea, road as well as rail.

Our facilities enable storage of hazardous & explosive materials per DG classification, in compliance with safety standards. Additionally, we also offer packaging, customs clearance, labelling and documentation for dangerous goods.</pre>
