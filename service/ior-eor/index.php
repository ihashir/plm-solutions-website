        <pre>We understand the need of the global trading community to have a reliable and exclusive organization to be their IOR (Importer Of Records) as well as EOR (Exporter of Record) to ensure they can easily expand cross border without the hindrance of establishing legal entities in each country they wish to operate. We have in-depth knowledge of customs, logistics and supply chain solutions which ensure us to address our customer’s needs in developing reliable and sustainable business solutions.

The solution we provide covers IOR/EOR requirements to multiple countries though a single billing mechanism thus providing one point of contact to all our customers.
